# module-1-challenge:

Description:

This project was focused on cleaning up the HTML and CSS code, updating the semantic elements in the HTML code, as well as adding accessible alt attributes. With a cleaner code and utilizing semantic elements, it becomes easier to work with these files in the future, whether for the original developer or anyone to follow. Accessible alt attributes are crucial to incorporate for several reasons, chiefly among them being accessibility for those with disabilities, optimization of access from search engines, and company liability for providing equitable access. 

The original HTML code did not have many semantic elements, which made it difficult to determine what part of the webpage was to be impacted by what was written. By updating the semantic elements, the code is more easily navigable. These additions made the CSS code less repetitive, which keeps them in line with best practices.
